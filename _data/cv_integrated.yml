- heading: Generative Models and LLMs
  items:
  - title: CaDDi
    description: Developed <strong>CaDDi</strong>, a Non-Markovian Discrete Diffusion framework that unifies discrete diffusion with causal LLMs—two core paradigms in natural language generation previously viewed as orthogonal.
    details:
    - By breaking the longstanding Markovian assumption in discrete diffusion models, <strong>CaDDi</strong> achieves <strong>more coherent text generation</strong>—demonstrated by lower generative perplexity compared to prior discrete diffusion approaches.
    - Finetuned a Qwen-3 1.5B LLM to perform diffusion-style denoising, achieving improved performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks.
    - Published as a co-first author at NeurIPS 2025.
  - title: CaLMFlow
    description: Developed <strong>CaLMFlow</strong>, a flow-matching paradigm that reformulates the problem from solving an ODE to a Volterra integral equation, mitigating <strong>stiffness</strong> issues commonly encountered in ODE-based formulations.
    details:
    - Applied <strong>CaLMFlow</strong> to single-cell perturbation response prediction, demonstrating <strong>superior ability to model the underlying data distribution</strong> and <strong>significantly improved extrapolation to OOD perturbations</strong> compared to specialized baselines.
- heading: LLM Agentic Systems for Biological Data Curation
  items:
  - title: DNA Methylation Curation
    description: Developing an <strong>LLM-based multi-agent system</strong> for large-scale, automated curation of DNA methylation datasets.
    details:
    - Designed a <strong>fully automated</strong> and <strong>generalizable</strong> pipeline that adapts to unseen datasets and aligns with the workflow needs of biological researchers.
    - The pipeline <strong>scales to thousands of publicly available datasets</strong> and reduces curation workloads that previously required years of manual effort by multiple biologists to just a few hours.
    - Designed for <strong>deployment as a continuous system</strong> that automatically downloads, curates, and updates relevant public datasets, providing biologists with clean, standardized data to accelerate downstream research.
