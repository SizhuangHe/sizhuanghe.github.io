## About Me

I'm a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), advised by Dr. [David van Dijk](https://www.vandijklab.org/). 

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/), majoring in [Honors Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) and minoring in [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/).

I am interested in <u>Generative Modeling</u>, <u>Operator Learning</u> and their applications in <u>Computational Biology</u>.

## Research Interests

- **Generative Modeling:** Flow Matching, Diffusion, Discrete Diffusion
- **Operator Learning:** Modeling Continuous Spatiotemporal Dynamics, Integral Equations
- **Computational Biology:** Single-cell Transcriptomics Data Analysis
