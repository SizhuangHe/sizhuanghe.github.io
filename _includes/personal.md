## Personal Life
Beyond research, my biggest passions include:
- **<span style="color: var(--global-theme-color); font-weight: bold;">Football 🏈:</span>** I am a dedicated Michigan Wolverines fan 〽️ (Go Blue!) in college football and root for the Detroit Lions in the NFL.
- <span style="color: var(--global-theme-color); font-weight: bold;">Traveling:</span> I enjoy exploring different cities—my all-time top three are Tokyo, Taipei, and Singapore. When visiting new places, I particularly enjoy experiencing local train systems, with my favorite being the Yamanote Line 🟢 operated by JR East in Tokyo.
